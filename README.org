All my Dotfiles managed with gnu stow

* Usage

  I have some install scripts that help me installing softwares on my
  different computers.

  I split my dotfiles in different directories and I use stow to
  symlink those directories on my machines.

  Example Usage:

  - run /install_linux.sh/
  - run /stow <directory-name>/ commands to symlink directories
    For example on my linux desktop machine I run:
    /stow home/
    /stow home_linux/
    /stow_home_linux_desktop/


* bin

  The bin directory contains scripts that I use from time to time.

  There are scripts to
  - get the local time in San Francisco
  - launch tmux sessions /tat/
  - test colors in the terminal /colortest/
  - get the dropbox status /dropboxStatus/
  - change the brigthness on my laptop /brightness/.
