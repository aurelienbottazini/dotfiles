All my Dotfiles managed with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]

You can find in this repo advanced configurations for Emacs, Vim, Tmux.

* Usage

  All the directories are meant to be used with stow. I split my
  config files depending on usage and importance of the software.
  For example Emacs as a dedicated folder even though It could have
  been included inside the ~home~ directory.

  Example Usage:

  run ~stow <directory-name>~ commands to symlink directories.
  Those example commands will work if this repository is checked out
  as a subfolder of your home directory. For example ~\~/dotfiles~
  For example on my linux desktop machine I run:
  ~stow home~
  ~stow home_linux~

  Directories containing root is their filename should be run with with ~sudo stow -t / root~.
