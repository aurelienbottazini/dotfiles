All my Dotfiles managed with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]]

Includes config files for:
 - Emacs
 - Vim
 - Fish
 - Xmonad
 - Xmobar
 - Bash
 - Git
 - st
 - dmenu

* Usage

  All the directories are meant to be used with stow. I split my
  config files depending on usage and importance of the software.
  For example Emacs as a dedicated folder even though It could have
  been included inside the ~home~ directory.

  Example Usage:

  run ~stow <directory-name>~ commands to symlink directories.
  Those example commands will work if this repository is checked out
  as a subfolder of your home directory. For example ~\~/dotfiles~
  For example on my linux desktop machine I run:
  ~stow home~
  ~stow home_linux~

  There is one exception with the ~root~ directory.
  It needs to be run with ~stow -t / root~. It contains files specific
  to my linux configuration and involving what I consider tricky settings.
