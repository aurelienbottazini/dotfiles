All my Dotfiles managed with gnu stow

To test if your terminal uses 256 colors:
$ perl dotfiles/bin/colortest -w

Usage:

- Run install.sh

Emacs:

- For neotree icons, install the fonts in the .emacs/fonts subdirectory

Scripts Notes:

- bin/sendmail.rb
  a script I use to quickly send email to third party services to trigger
  alerts, reminders etcs.

  You need a .env file with user name and password env variables for your
  preferred smtp server to use bin/send_mail.rb
