Searching is probably the most important thing in a code editor.
Here is how I search.

* Main command

  ~counsel-rg~ is my main way to search. Invoked with an argument, it
  allows you to specify the directory and search options.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
   (use-package counsel
     :bind (:map my-keys-minor-mode-map ("C-c f" . counsel-rg)))
  #+end_src

  When I am investigating things, I like to see a preview of the
  results as I scroll down the search results. I do it with ~C-o~ then
  either ~g~ on the entry I want to preview or ~c~ to automatically
  preview results as I move through the result list.

  A trick I am learning is to use more ~C-'~ to jump directly to a
  search results.

* When I need to search specific files

  ~C-x d~ to launch dired . I mark the files I am interested in with
  ~m~. Then I can grep those files with ~A~ and do a query replace
  with ~Q~.
